# Submitting a resigned app to Apple

Unfortunately, when using isign, you will not be able to simply let XCode figure out signing and submitting for you.

Here are some possible procedures for doing this. They worked as of October 2019 with current MacOS and the 
Apple Developer ecosystem.

## Manual procedure

We assume you are using the `bash` shell on a contemporary MacOS computer.

The overview: we will resign the app locally, and then upload it to App Store Connect via `xcrun altool`.

### Preparation (one-time only)

Add your Apple Developer Account App Store username as an environment variable to your `.bash_profile`. 
In most cases, this is identical to your Apple Developer Account username, and is usually an email address.

```bash
export APP_STORE_USERNAME=you@your.domain
```

You might also want to add this to your `.bash_profile`, to set up paths to additional tools such as `altool`.
 
```bash
xcode-select -r     # to set up paths. 
```

Once added, restart your terminal to get the correct paths.

With your web browser, on `https://developer.apple.com/`, prepare your accounts and certificates for distribution.

We'll also need to set up an "app password" to be used by `altool`. Log in to `https://appleid.apple.com/`, and
scroll to the "Security" section. Set up an app password, and label it "altool". Store this password somewhere 
secure. 

### Password security

Later on you're going to need to use this password on the command line. _This is a potential 
security vulnerability_. The command and its arguments can be observed by other processes on your machine, and it will automatically be stored in your `.bash_history`.

So, the best practice would be to store it someplace secure, and then obtain it for use on the command line, in some way that doesn't leave traces.

Here are a couple of options:

* Apple Keychain: If you choose to store the above password in the Apple Keychain, there is a way to use it directly
  with the command line for `altool` where you would normally use a password. See `man altool` for the details.
  
* Other password managers: you can simply cut & paste from your password manager app such as 1Password or Lastpass.
  
  Since you probably want to create builds very often, you can also try automating this with a command-line tool to 
  retrieve secrets from your password manager. 
    * [1Password command-line tool](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/), or `brew install 1password-cli`
    * [Lastpass command-line tool](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/use-the-lastpass-command-line-application-lp040011) or `brew install lastpass-cli`
  
  For example, here's how one might use the LastPass `lastpass-cli` package.
  
  In your LastPass vault, make a pseudo-website called "developer.apple.com-altool" 
  without a username and using the altool password as password. Then you can make a bash script 
  like this:
  ```bash
  $ export APP_STORE_PASSWORD=$(lpass show developer.apple.com-altool --password)
  ```
  

In the following examples, we'll assume that (somehow) the password exists in the environment variable 
`$APP_STORE_PASSWORD`.

### When you build your app

Open your app project in XCode.



#### Bundle version
When you submit to Apple, you need to keep bumping the bundle version. If you don't have some automatic 
way to do that, you can manually edit the file `Info.plist` or use `isign`'s `-i` option to edit the values while resigning. TBD example. A simple thing to do is to call your first version 0.01,
then increment to 0.02, etc.

If you're using XCode, enter the same string in:

* Bundle versions string, short
* Bundle version


At the top of the window select “Generic iOS Device” as your build target.
 
Select “Product > Archive”.

This will compile your project, then pop up the Archives window.

Select the archive you just made and press the “Distribute App” button.

Select “App Store Connect”, and press “Next”.

Select “Export”,  and press “Next”.

Select the appropriate options for bitcode and symbol retention, and press  “Next”.

Select “Automatically manage signing”. (We're going to let XCode sign it once for us, with some developer identity,
and resign it later with `isign`.)

XCode will present you with a summary of all these options. Confirm them by pressing “Export” and select a 
destination directory.

In the terminal, cd to the directory you created, there should be an IPA there.

Use `isign` to resign this IPA, for example

```bash
$ isign -o resigned.ipa original.ipa
```

Lastly (and this is what we've been building up to...) use `altool` to validate and submit:

```bash
$ xcrun altool —validate-app --file ./resigned.ipa --username "$APP_STORE_USERNAME" --password "$APP_STORE_PASSWORD"
$ xcrun altool --upload-app --file ./resigned.ipa --username "$APP_STORE_USERNAME" --password "$APP_STORE_PASSWORD"

```


## Semi-automated procedure

TBD - add an action to XCode build pipeline



## Submitting a resigned app without source available

This is for the unlikely case where you have an IPA, and want to resign it to for App Store Distribution with a completely different organization.

First, be aware that if you try to distribute a resigned version of someone else's work without their permission, you are a) a bad person b) going to be in trouble. They have ways of catching you.

In the event that you do have permission, or, if you simply want to do some testing of isign, here's how you would do it.

You have to override the existing bundle identifier, from say `test.originalapp` to `com.example.myapp` this is what you need to do.

Each app has a bundle identifier, like `com.example.mytestapp`.  You must:
* Create an application record in App Store Connect.
* Create an identifier matching this bundle
* Create a certificate compatible with the iOS App Store for this identifier
* Create a provisioning profile compatible with the iOS App Store and this bundle identifier.
* when resigning, use the `-i` option to change the bundle when resigning, e.g.

`isign -i CFBundleIdentifier=net.neilk.mytestapp -o resignedWithNewCFBI.ipa original.ipa`

Many apps can be resigned with only the CFBundleIdentifier changed, but not all. For instance,
apps that are part of an app group will need other properties edited.

TBD: add docs for such properties here.
