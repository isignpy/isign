    """
       iOS apps use different kinds of identifiers (bundle ids, application ids, etc) usually in the form
       of TEAMID.tld.domain.myapp.myotherthing and sometimes with wildcards at the end like TEAMID.* .

       It is sometimes important to know if one id encompasses another. For instance, if you have a provisioning
       profile whose "application-identifier" covers TEAMID.foo.bar.*, and you have a bundle whose CFBundleIdentifier
       is TEAMID.foo.bar.baz. Is that provisioning profile good? In this case yes.

       This class also helps us decide which of many options is the most specific fit

       Because id is so overloaded here, the id we are trying to "fit" into is called the pattern, even if it's just
       another id.
