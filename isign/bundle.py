""" Represents a bundle. In the words of the Apple docs, it's a convenient way to deliver
    software. Really it's a particular kind of directory structure, with one main executable,
    well-known places for various data files and libraries,
    and tracking hashes of all those files for signing purposes.

    For isign, we have two main kinds of bundles: the App, and the Framework (a reusable
    library packaged along with its data files.) An App may contain many Frameworks, but
    a Framework has to be re-signed independently.
